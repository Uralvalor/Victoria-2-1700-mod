AHD DD2 – Railroads and Tradegoods

First up we have added a new screen with more detailed information about goods.

This is accessable both from the trade and production screens so will help both with deciding how to trade and what factories to construct or close. The much longer history graph should also be helpful for this.

We have also been working on some economic changes this week. Capitalists are getting a big boost (up to 3x in laissez faire) compared to governments when it comes to building factories and railroads cheaply. Overall though constructions are going to get a lot more expensive. It should no longer be a no-brainer to put railroads in each province. Currently costs are up 10x across the board, but we will see if they stay there after balance testing.

Speaking of railroads, they are now affected by terrain. Different terrain types require a certain tech level for you to be able to construct the railroad there, so for example to build in the Alps you might be required to have level 4 researched. This minimum level also works as a penalty so a level 4 railroad in mountains will only effectively work like a level 1 basic railroad. These things combined should hopefully make for some more interesting choices on where to build your railway net.
