desc_ev_20000082;"Torricelli's chief invention was the mercury barometer. ""This instrument is named from two Greek words, signifying two measures of weight, since by it a column of air is weighed against a column of mercury."" The barometer arose from the need to solve a practical problem. Pump makers of the Grand Duke of Tuscany attempted to raise water to a height of 12 meters or more, but found that 10 meters was the limit with a suction pump (as recounted in Galileo's Dialogue). Torricelli employed mercury, fourteen times more dense than water. In 1643 he created a tube approximately one meter long, sealed at the top, filled it with mercury, and set it vertically into a basin of mercury. The column of mercury fell to about 76 cm, leaving a Torricellian vacuum above. As we now know, the column's height fluctuated with changing atmospheric pressure; this was the first barometer. The discovery of the principle of the barometer has perpetuated his fame (""Torricellian tube"", ""Torricellian vacuum"").";x;;

ev_20000090;Stockholms Banco Issues Banknotes;x;;
desc_ev_20000090;Johan Palmstruch had made two failed proposals for the creation of a banking institution in the 1650s before his third proposal, with the addition of a promise to pay half of the bank's profits to the crown, was accepted. King Charles X Gustav thus signed two charters on November 30, 1656 to create an exchange bank and a loans bank. The bank itself was no great innovation as it was simply an imitation of the large and successful banks in Amsterdam and Hamburg that had been founded earlier in the 17th century, but it was hoped that the bank would help to stabilise Sweden's currency. Sweden at that time did not have a single currency, rather there was one daler minted in copper (kopparmynt) and another minted in silver (silvermynt). As the metal content of a copper daler had to be worth as much as that of a silver one, this meant that copper daler were large and heavy plate-sized coins. In practice, however, the silver daler was worth more and these were often hoarded, so generally only these large kopparmynt daler were commonly available. Palmstruch's second major innovation was the introduction of paper banknotes as a solution to the bank's problems balancing deposits and loans. To cover the amounts requested by the account holders, in 1661 he began to make out credit notes (Kreditivsedlar) in round denominations which were freely transferable and backed by the promise of future payment in metal. These were the first European banknotes.;x;;

Cheap foreign imports of copper had forced the Crown to steadily increase the size of the copper coinage to maintain its value relative to silver. The heavy weight of the new coins encouraged merchants to deposit it in exchange for receipts.
